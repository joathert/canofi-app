Canofi (rhymes with butterfly)  is an educational web-app that explores the use of panoramic imagery for plant science applications. 

The current focus of Canofi is on the estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) via a hemispherical reprojection. You can read all about LAI on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index) where there is also a decent introduction to [hemispherical photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherical_photography).

The use of panoramas means we can skip the expensive hardware that is usually used when collecting hemispherical imagery. Smartphone panoramas work just fine, especially when collected with the Google Street View app. 

Canofi is powered by the excellent [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which lets us run the scientific python stack within the browser. 

## Algorithms and issues
Note that the reprojection method can be achieved with a whole bunch of different software including the Gimp, 
ImageMagick, or even Scipy (interpolate.griddata). The Scipy method was used in Haozhou Wangâ€™s thesis, which you can find [here](https://github.com/HowcanoeWang/Spherical2TreeAttributes). Wang's method appeared to produce somewhat smoother imagery than the method used here, at the expense of processing time and memory. That is why we use the sklearn method for the browser but if you are conducting research then should investigate the various options.   

The browser image loading is complicated by the fact that the embedded python code refused to work with jpeg files. That is why input image files are first sent to a canvas and re-read in as fixed sized png files at lower resolution.  This convoluted step is not neccessary using standard python, so use that for important research.  

## Testing of algorithms
This testing is only for validation of the algorithms used in Canofi versus
offline reference implementations. It does not test the validty of the method
versus fisheye hardware, there are publications on that (e.g. [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.422956v2.full).
